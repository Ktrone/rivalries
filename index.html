				<h2>A little about me</h2>
				<p>Hello my name is Kaleb and I have lived in between St. Louis and Chicago my whole life, I also played hockey when I was younger. When I was younger I was more of a Blackhawks fan because where I lived and some of my family members were as well. As I grew up me and my family would take vacations down to St. Louis and one time we got tickets to go see a Blues game, I fell in love with the team again. I forgot to mention when I turned five for my birthday me, my dad, my uncle, and my grandpas all went to a blues game and for one of my gifts I got a custom jersey with my name. So I guess I've always been a Blues fan but I do love the rivalry between the Blues and the Blackhawks.</p>

					<h3>	
						The St. Louis Blues had there inaugural season in 1967 along with the Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota North Stars The now Dallas Stars, Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, and Pittsburgh Penguins. The Blues are in the Central Division and Western Conference. The blues won the Stanly Cup Playoffs in 2019 after being in last place in the league on January 2nd 2019, shortly before that they fired there head coach Mike Yeo and hired there interim coach Craig Berube. One thing to note about the culture of hockey is that everyone is very superstitious so on the night of January 6th 2019 a few blues players were in a bar when Gloria by Laura Branigan came on and everyone was dancing to it so at that moment they said that they should play that after our wins, so the following day rookie goaltender Jordan Binigton started and he got a shutout so after that night they slowly got better and ended up getting the third spot in the Central Division and winning The Stanly Cup.

The Blackhawks have won six time they've won it in 1934, 1938, 1961, 2010, 2013, and 2015.

					<h3>
					The rivalry between the Blues and the Blackhawks started when the Blues joined the same division as the Blackhawks back in 1970 and is considered the most intense rivalry in the NHL in terms of penalty and fighting minutes. Back then it wasn't to uncommon to have a bench clearing brawl when these two teams played each other. In recent years the rivalry has developed more it went away for a bit in the 90s era but then shortly came back to its former glory. Perceptually in the 2014 Stanly Cup Playoffs when the Blackhawks beat the Blues in the first round coming back after training a 2-0 they won the series 4-2. They once again played each other in the 2016 Stanly cup Playoffs when the Blues jumped to a 3-1 series lead over the Blackhawks but the Blackhawks came back and won games five and six to go to game seven, where the Blues won with a score of 3-2 with a goal by former Blackhawks player Troy Brouwer to win the series. Although the Blues and Blackhawks have been playing in the same division every year last season the 20-21 season they unfortunately did not get to play in the same division due to the league division change due to COVID-19. Good news the rivalry should be fine due to the next 21-22 season where they're in the same division once again and they play a total of four times. There first game is the 30th of October followed by November 26th then in January on the 30th then the last time they meet in the regular season is on the 27th of February. With the additon to Vezina Trophy winner Marc-Andre Fleury and with some roster changes for the Bluesno matter how this season plays out it will be nice to see thes clubs get back together.
