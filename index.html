				<h2>A little about me</h2>
				<p>Hello my name is Kaleb and I have lived in between St. Louis and Chicago my whole life, I also played hockey when I was younger. When I was younger I was more of a Blackhawks fan because where I lived and some of my family members were as well. As I grew up me and my family would take vacations down to St. Louis and one time we got tickets to go see a Blues game, I fell in love with the team again. I forgot to mention when I turned five for my birthday me, my dad, my uncle, and my grandpas all went to a blues game and for one of my gifts I got a custom jersey with my name. So I guess I've always been a Blues fan but I do love the rivalry between the Blues and the Blackhawks.</p>

					<h3>	
						The St. Louis Blues had there inaugural season in 1967 along with the Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota North Stars The now Dallas Stars, Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, and Pittsburgh Penguins. The Blues are in the Central Division and Western Conference. The blues won the Stanly Cup Playoffs in 2019 after being in last place in the league on January 2nd 2019, shortly before that they fired there head coach Mike Yeo and hired there interim coach Craig Berube. One thing to note about the culture of hockey is that everyone is very superstitious so on the night of January 6th 2019 a few blues players were in a bar when Gloria by Laura Branigan came on and everyone was dancing to it so at that moment they said that they should play that after our wins, so the following day rookie goaltender Jordan Binigton started and he got a shutout so after that night they slowly got better and ended up getting the third spot in the Central Division and winning The Stanly Cup.
